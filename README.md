This datapack re-imagines vanilla Minecraft terrain in a way which seeks to inspire a greater sense of awe, wonder, and beauty. It takes inspiration from some of the features of terrain generation from Minecraft Beta 1.7.3 and versions before, like towering cliffs, floating islands, and crazy overhangs, and integrates them into the elegant, cascading terrain made possible by the new terrain generator introduced in 1.18. The aim here is for the player to discover many distinct 'natural landmarks' as they explore the world, which inspire them to build and explore further. The introduction of fully-traversible rivers (including underground rivers) mean that the player can also explore their world by boat much more easily.

At the same time, it seeks to preserve the vanilla balance and feel, not adding any new structures or drastically different new biomes, ensuring that it is survival-friendly.

Key terrain features added:

- More overhangs, cliffs, and floating islands
- Proper sand and gravel beaches
- Larger continents and oceans
- Expansive lakes dotted with small islands
- Underground rivers
- Smoother transitions from land to water

There are two different variants of this datapack:

1. Cascades - The original version of this pack with new terrain, some edits to vanilla biomes, and a few new biomes.
2. Cascades: Source - A slimmed-down version of this pack which only contains the terrain changes. This should be, broadly-speaking, compatible with other world generation datapacks which add new biomes.
